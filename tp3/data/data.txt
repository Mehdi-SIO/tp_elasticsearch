The phrase \"super hero\" had yet to be coined when ACTION COMICS #1 hit newsstands in 1938, but once Superman entered the scene, effortlessly lifting a car above his head on that first iconic cover, the character paved the way for each of the hundreds (if not thousands) of super-powered heroes written since. <br><br>SUPERMAN: A CELEBRATION OF 75 YEARS gathers a range of stories featuring the first and greatest super hero, highlighting the many roles the Man of Steel has played over the decades. In these celebrated stories, Superman is in turns the Herculean champion, the lonely alien survivor, the super-powered Boy Scout and the soul-searching leader. Over the course of seventy-five years, watch as the character grows from a simple strongman to the beloved international symbol he is today!<br><br>This Volume Collects:<br><br><b>(\"Superman, Champion of the Oppressed\") / (\"War in San Monte\") -- ACTION COMICS #1-2 (1938)</b> Writer: Jerry Siegel, Artist: Joe Shuster<br><b>\"How Superman Would End the War\" -- Look Magazine</b> (1940) Writer: Jerry Siegel, Artist: Joe Shuster<br><b>\"Man or Superman?\" -- SUPERMAN #17 (1942)</b> Writer: Jerry Siegel, Penciller: Joe Shuster, Inker: Joe Sikela<br><b>\"The Origin of Superman\" -- SUPERMAN #53</b> (1948) Writer: Bill Finger, Penciller: Wayne Boring, Inker: Stan Kaye<br><b>\"The Mightiest Team in the World\" -- SUPERMAN #76</b> (1952) Writer: Edmond Hamilton, Penciller: Curt Swan, Inker: John Fishchetti<br><b>\"The Super-Duel in Space\" -- ACTION COMICS #242 (1958)</b> Writer: Otto Binder, Artist: Al Plastino<br><b>\u00a0\"The Girl From Superman's Past\" -- SUPERMAN #129 (1959) </b>Writer: Bill Finger, Penciller: Wayne Boring, Inker: Stan Kaye<br><b>\"Superman's Return to Krypton\" -- SUPERMAN #141 (1960)</b> Writer: Jerry Siegel, Penciller: Wayne Boring, Inker: Stan Kaye<br><b>\"The Death of Superman\" -- SUPERMAN #149 (1961)</b> Writer: Jerry Siegel, Penciller: Curt Swan, Inker: George Klein<br><b>\"Must There Be a Superman?\" -- SUPERMAN #247 (1972)</b> Writer: Eliot S.

{"summary": "The first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas began in 1791 when thousands of brutally exploited slaves rose up against their masters on Saint-Domingue, the most profitable colony in the eighteenth-century Atlantic world. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794. This victory was a stunning challenge to the order of master/slave relations throughout the Americas, including the southern United States, reinforcing the most fervent hopes of slaves and the worst fears of masters. But, peace eluded Saint-Domingue as British and Spanish forces attacked the colony. A charismatic ex-slave named Toussaint Louverture came to France\u2019s aid, raising armies of others like himself and defeating the invaders. Ultimately Napoleon, fearing the enormous political power of Toussaint, sent a massive mission to crush him and subjugate the ex-slaves. After many battles, a decisive victory over the French secured the birth of Haiti and the permanent abolition of slavery from the land. The independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States and the expansion of the Cuban sugar economy. <b>Laurent Dubois</b> weaves the stories of slaves, free people of African descent, wealthy whites, and French administrators into an unforgettable tale of insurrection, war, heroism, and victory.

{"summary": "Since 1940, Captain America has battled his enemies in the name of American values, and as those values have changed over time, so has Captain America's character. Because the comic book world fosters a close fan-creator dialogue, creators must consider their ever-changing readership. Comic book artists must carefully balance storyline continuity with cultural relevance. Captain America's seventy-year existence spans from World War II through the Cold War to the American War on Terror; beginning as a soldier unopposed to offensive attacks against foreign threats, he later becomes known as a defender whose only weapon is his iconic shield. In this way, Captain America reflects America's need to renegotiate its social contract and reinvent its national myths and cultural identity, all the while telling stories proclaiming an eternal and unchanging spirit of America.    In Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence, Stevens reveals how the comic book hero has evolved to maintain relevance to America's fluctuating ideas of masculinity, patriotism, and violence. Stevens outlines the history of Captain America's adventures and places the unfolding storyline in dialogue with the comic book industry as well as America's varying political culture. Stevens shows that Captain America represents the ultimate American story: permanent enough to survive for nearly seventy years with a history fluid enough to be constantly reinterpreted to meet the needs of an ever-changing culture.", "title": "Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence: The Evolution of a National Icon (Television and Popular Culture)"}

{"summary": "Built millions of years before humanity ever dreamed of space, the Hulks are ancient starships, miles long, drifting silent and purposeless through space. They are completely, horribly alien. Just setting foot on a Hulk is enough to drive a person mad, but if humanity want to survive in a hostile universe it needs the power trapped inside them. \n<br />\n<br />Part 1:\n<br />\n<br />1962: Humanity has beaten back the first wave of alien invaders and is preparing for the second. Europe is a smoking ruin, and in the U.S., the CIA grabs more and more power as they hunt the last surviving aliens and the human sympathizers that use their technology to terrorize the country. With no idea why the aliens attacked, or when they might return, this is a war of information that we can\u2019t afford to lose.\n<br />\n<br />2145: The lifeblood of the human empire is Coal, a form of crystalline energy found only in the enormous, drifting starships left behind by a long-dead civilization. But mankind isn\u2019t the only species mining these Hulks, and now they\u2019re caught in a war with a savage alien race who\u2019ve claimed the Hulks for themselves.

His first subjects belonged to the treasurer of the UK Budgie Society, who deemed his portraits \"crap\" because he had omitted the legs and tails. He subsequently developed an eye for the nuances of bird photography, and, making a specialty of photographing show birds of all kinds, developed the body of work gathered in this volume. While Stephenson's photographs depict these birds with apparent neutrality (against a variety of colored backgrounds), Michael Smith observes in his foreword to this volume that \"they live in an overlap between the natural and manmade worlds, and say as much about the culture that created them as they do about nature.\"", "title": "Luke Stephenson: An Incomplete Dictionary of Show Birds"}
